# Numerix

A collection of (potentially) useful mathematical functions. At the moment it has a number of distance and correlation functions. The plan is to implement other special functions, statistics, probability distributions, maybe even machine learning algorithms.

## Installation

Add `numerix` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:numerix, "~> 0.0.1"}]
    end
```
